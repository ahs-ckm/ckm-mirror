Proceed with procedure once it has been determined that pregnancy does not exist. Order: Lab HCG.b. Provide written consent that is it in the best interest of the patient to proceed. Consent can be provided by Referring physician or Radiologist. Order: Complete consent form.c. Consider alternative imaging.</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Patient Requirements</key><value>Catheter requirements: A urinary catheter may be required to ensure bladder is empty. If patient has a urinary catheter already, please do not remove until all imaging is complete. Incontinent patients should be catheterized prior to procedure.;Pediatric: Nutrition: Increase fluids.;Pediatric: Fasting necessary for sedation cases only: No solids or formula for 6 hours, no breast feeding for 4 hours, no clear fluids (water, apple juice, soft drinks, Jell-O) for 3 hours, no chewing gum for 6 hours.;Pediatric: IV requirements: Prior to coming to Nuclear Medicine department, establish peripheral IV access with saline lock attachment. Alternative is a straight injection from Technologist. Injection location/site will depend on reason for exam.</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Clinical Communication</key><value>Inpatient Clinical Communication: This is a 2 part/visit examination.  The initial visit to receive the injection takes 10-30 minutes with the possibility of images.  A minimum of 2-4 hours later the patient returns for imaging that takes up to 60 minutes. No prep prior to injection. Patient may eat, drink and take medications as normal. Between injection and imaging, encourage fluid intake and frequent voiding. Urine in the bladder may obscure pelvis images. Females of child bearing age (11-55 years) shall complete a pregnancy screen prior to the exam. Please bring eye glasses and hearing aid if required. Notify the Nuclear Medicine department if a Translation Service is required. Breastfeeding must be completely discontinued after scan.Pediatric:  May need in and out catheterization to empty bladder. Parent/legal guardian is encouraged to accompany the patient. Send translator if required.;Outpatient Clinical Communication: There is no special preparation for this exam. This is a 2-part examination. During the first part, you will have a radioactive injection in the arm and possibly some images taken. This takes approximately 30 minutes. You will need to return 2-4 hours later for imaging which will take up to 60 minutes. Females of child bearing age (11-55 years) shall complete a pregnancy screen prior to the exam.  Please bring eye glasses, hearing aid, or an interpreter if required.                             Patients from assisted living facilities should be accompanied by a family member or aide. Bring any medications (pain meds or any other) required from home. You may want to bring a lunch to eat in the Diagnostic Imaging Department. Patients who are unable to use the washroom should have a urinary catheter in place for the duration of the exam to prevent contamination of the area of interest on the image.</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Synonyms</key><value>NM Bone Scan</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Resources </key><value>http://insite.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/policy/clp-di-prov-dis2-2-1-rad-protect-female-pts.pdf</value></item></items></annotations><definition xsi:type="INSTRUCTION" archetype_id="openEHR-EHR-INSTRUCTION.service_request.v1" concept_name="Service request" max="1" name="NM Bone Scan"/><integrity_checks xsi:type="ArchetypeIntegrity" archetype_id="openEHR-EHR-INSTRUCTION.service_request.v1"><digest id="MD5-CAM-1.0.1">B48161A11EF4549FFAE82EE73B385AF5</digest></integrity_checks><integrity_checks xsi:type="ArchetypeIntegrity" archetype_id="openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.service_request_information.v1"><digest id="MD5-CAM-1.0.1">230A8D964017E1FD7AC82EBDEE0202A6</digest></integrity_checks></template>
