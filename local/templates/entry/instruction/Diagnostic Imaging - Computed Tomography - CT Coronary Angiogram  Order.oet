Resume previous infusion orders. Keep existing IV/saline lock TKVO, discontinue IV/saline lock when patient is ready for discharge.  Encourage clear fluids, unless otherwise indicated, for patients who have received an intravenous radiopaque contrast media, to flush contrast from kidneys. Diabetic patients on Metformin (or derivative) who have received an intravenous radiopaque contrast media may be instructed to discontinue medication for 48 hours as per radiologists order if GFR &lt;45 ml/min and a follow up Creatinine is required before Metformin therapy can begin.;Nutrition: Resume previous diet.;Bed Rest: Until vitals return to pre medicated state.;Vitals: q15 mins x 4, q30 mins until vitals return to pre medicated state.;Notify Radiologist if procedural concerns arise.;Metformin information will be provided by DI based on patient GFR level and sent with patient.

All inpatients who have any of the identified risk factors must have a serum creatinine obtained and a GFR calculated within 1 week prior to intravascular contrast media administration. Risk factors for acute or chronic renal impairment and/or development of contrast induced nephropathy for adults are identified as: Diabetes mellitus, Renal disease or solitary kidney, Sepsis or acute hypotension, Dehydration or volume contraction, Age greater than 70 years, Previous chemotherapy, Organ transplant, Vascular disease (hypertension, congestive heart disease, cardiac or peripheral vascular disease), Nephrotoxic Drugs (Loop diuretics, amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, vancomycin, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, cancer and immune suppressant chemotherapy drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), Human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).;Nutrition: No solid food 4 hours prior to exam, encourage clear fluids. No alcohol, nicotine (cigarettes, patch or snuff), caffeine (tea, pop, chocolate, coffee) for 24 hours prior to scan.;IV Requirements: 18 gauge IV, right antecubital fossa preferred when clinically possible, power PICC, or pressure injectable CVC line.;Pre-procedure Medications: Metoprolol is used for heart rate control and control of heart rate variability. Ordering physician is required to prescribe Metoprolol for their patient as long as no contraindications to Beta Blocker medications exist. The heart rate must be below 60 beats per minute for scan.;Restrictions: No Phosphodiesterase (ie. Viagra, Cialis, Levitra) or Barium studies 48 hours prior.

Consent is required for contrast enhanced studies for patients with significant risk factors (GFR&lt;30 or pre treated for a high risk of contrast reactions). If the patient is unable to give consent independently, ensure that the co-decision maker or alternate decision maker(s) accompany the patient to Diagnostic Imaging, or that a two physician consent is completed as per AHS Policy.
