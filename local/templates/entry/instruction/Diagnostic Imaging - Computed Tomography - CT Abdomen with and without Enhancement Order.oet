All inpatients who have any of the identified risk factors must have a serum creatinine obtained and a GFR calculated within 1 week prior to intravascular contrast media administration. Risk factors for acute or chronic renal impairment and/or development of contrast induced nephropathy for adults are identified as: Diabetes mellitus, Renal disease or solitary kidney, Sepsis or acute hypotension, Dehydration or volume contraction, Age greater than 70 years, Previous chemotherapy, Organ transplant, Vascular disease (hypertension, congestive heart disease, cardiac or peripheral vascular disease), Nephrotoxic Drugs (Loop diuretics, amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, vancomycin, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, cancer and immune suppressant chemotherapy drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), Human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).;Oral Contrast Preparation: Radiologist will determine the type, amount and timing of oral contrast to be given to the patient at the time of protocolling. This will be communicated by DI at the point of contact with the unit. Do not activate oral contrast until you have been contacted by DI. Positive oral contrast option: ie: Telebrix 22ml in 1500ml of water. Negative oral contrast option: Water. Radiologist may recommend other options for positive oral contrast which will be communicated by DI to the unit.;Nutrition: No solid food 4 hours prior to exam, encourage clear fluids.;IV requirements: 20 gauge IV minimum with saline lock attachment, power PICC, or pressure injectable CVC line. Antecubital IV site preferred.;Pediatric: Oral Contrast Preparation: If oral contrast is needed, DI will send. Under 15kg/Newborn - 3yrs,  6ml of Omnipaque in 200 ml clear fluid (newborns up to 120 ml of mixed solution). 15-22kg/3-6 years, 10ml of Omnipaque in 350 ml clear fluid. 23-30kg/6-12 years, 15ml of Omnipaque in 600 ml clear fluid. 30kg +/ 12+ years, 20ml of Omnipaque in 750 ml clear fluid.;Pediatric: Nutrition: No solid foods 3 hours prior, encourage clear fluids.;Pediatric: IV requirements: 20 or 22 gauge IV required, attach saline lock, extension tubing and antecubital IV site preferred.</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Clinical Communication</key><value>Inpatient Clinical Communication: Radiologist will determine the type, amount and timing of oral contrast to be given to the patient at the time of protocolling. This will be communicated by DI at the point of contact with the unit. Do not activate oral contrast until you have been contacted by DI. Radiologist may recommend other options for positive oral contrast which will be communicated by DI to the unit. For pediatrics, oral contrast will be provided by DI if required. Bring eye glasses and hearing aid to the DI department. Notify the CT department if Translation Service is required prior to the procedure.Â Please remove any metallic objects from area of scan. If sedation is required notify the CT department prior to procedure. Patient should be dressed in hospital gown only. Intact hospital and applicable allergy ID bands required. Consent is required for contrast enhanced studies for patients with significant risk factors (GFR&lt;30 or pre treated for a high risk of contrast reactions). If the patient is unable to give consent independently, ensure that the co-decision maker or alternate decision maker(s) accompany the patient to Diagnostic Imaging, or that a two physician consent is completed as per as per AHS Policy. If patient is on dialysis, notify CT department.;Outpatient Clinical Communication: Patient to follow nutrition requirements, no solid food 4 hours (Adults) or 3 hours (Pediatric) prior to exam, encourage clear fluids. Oral contrast will be administered in DI department at the time of the appointment. Patient to bring eye glasses and hearing aids to the DI department. Please remove any metallic objects from area of scan. Hospital and applicable allergy ID bands required and provided at time of registration. Patient will be required to change into hospital gown upon arrival. Notify the CT department if Translation Service is required prior to the procedure. Consent is required for contrast enhanced studies for patients with significant risk factors (GFR&lt;30 or pre treated for a high risk of contrast reactions). If the patient is unable to give consent independently, ensure that the co-decision maker or alternate decision maker(s) accompany the patient to Diagnostic Imaging, or that a two physician consent is completed as per AHS Policy. </value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Synonyms</key><value>CT Abdomen with and without Contrast</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Resources </key><value>http://insite.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/policy/clp-di-prov-dis1-2-ciinduced-nephropathy-metformin.pdf;http://insite.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/policy/clp-di-prov-dis2-2-1-rad-protect-female-pts.pdf</value></item></items></annotations><definition xsi:type="INSTRUCTION" archetype_id="openEHR-EHR-INSTRUCTION.service_request.v1" concept_name="Service request" max="1" name="CT Abdomen with and without Enhancement"/><integrity_checks xsi:type="ArchetypeIntegrity" archetype_id="openEHR-EHR-INSTRUCTION.service_request.v1"><digest id="MD5-CAM-1.0.1">B48161A11EF4549FFAE82EE73B385AF5</digest></integrity_checks><integrity_checks xsi:type="ArchetypeIntegrity" archetype_id="openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.service_request_information.v1"><digest id="MD5-CAM-1.0.1">230A8D964017E1FD7AC82EBDEE0202A6</digest></integrity_checks></template>
