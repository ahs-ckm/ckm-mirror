All inpatients who have any of the identified risk factors must have a serum creatinine obtained and a GFR calculated within 1 week prior to intravascular contrast media administration. Risk factors for acute or chronic renal impairment and/or development of contrast induced nephropathy for adults are identified as: Diabetes mellitus, Renal disease or solitary kidney, Sepsis or acute hypotension, Dehydration or volume contraction, Age greater than 70 years, Previous chemotherapy, Organ transplant, Vascular disease (hypertension, congestive heart disease, cardiac or peripheral vascular disease), Nephrotoxic Drugs (Loop diuretics, amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, vancomycin, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, cancer and immune suppressant chemotherapy drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), Human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).;Nutrition: No solid food 4 hours prior to exam, encourage clear fluids. (Adult); IV requirements: 20 gauge IV minimum with saline lock attachment, power PICC, or pressure injectable CVC line. Antecubital IV site preferred.;Pediatric: IV requirements: 20 or 22 gauge IV required, attach saline lock, extension tubing and antecubital IV site preferred.</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Clinical Communication</key><value>Inpatient Clinical Communication: Bring eye glasses and hearing aid to the DI department.

Consent is required for contrast enhanced studies for patients with significant risk factors (GFR&lt;30 or pre treated for a high risk of contrast reactions). If the patient is unable to give consent independently, ensure that the co-decision maker or alternate decision maker(s) accompany the patient to Diagnostic Imaging, or that a two physician consent is completed as per AHS Policy.
